If you changed the scheduler in 2.1.9beta1, please restore from an automatic
backup made prior to using beta1, in order to correct your review history.

When you switch between schedulers using beta2+, it will adjust the answers in
your review history for learning cards, to account for the fact that the 2nd button
was 'good' in the old scheduler, and is 'hard' in the new one. If you take a
screenshot of your 'answer buttons' graph prior to changing the scheduler,
you should find only the learning cards change. Please note that this means
if you downgrade to the normal scheduler, any 'hard' answers will be treated
as 'good' in that graph.

using this beta, please restore your collection from an automatic backup that
was made prior to updating, in order to correct your review history.

- Includes a separate anki-console.exe executable in the Windows build that
may be useful for add-on authors.
- Includes support for the fcitx input method and a gtk2 theme
in the Linux build.

You can switch between the standard and alternate 2.1.6 without problems.
If you move back to a previous Anki 2.1 release, your sync login details
and window positions will be lost, and will need to be set again.

*The standard version has updated requirements*:

- The Windows build only supports 64 bit Windows 7 or later, and will
not run on a 32 bit install.
- The Mac build requires macOS 10.12 or later.
- The Linux build requires a Linux distribution from approximately 2016
or later.

The alternate version is similar to previous Anki 2.1 releases, and is
built with an older toolkit. It will run on some older systems that
the standard version will not, but as it is not as up to date it may be
missing bugfixes and security improvements that the standard version includes.

*The alternate version (-alt) will run on*:

- Windows 7 32 bit or 64 bit installs
- Mac 10.10 or later.
- A Linux distro from around 2014 or later.

*In addition to the toolkit upgrade, there have been some changes in Anki itself*:

- Improvements to the Browse screen and flagging:
** Search text is normalized, which fixes problems searching for unicode
characters with multiple possible encodings.
** The selection is now partially transparent, allowing you to see the underyling
colours of the rows.
** The screen doesn't scroll when performing actions that don't change the
selection count.
** Flags now toggle on and off, and the separate clear flag action has been removed.
** The second flag is now orange instead of purple.
- Prevent errors caused by the user adding a field reference to itself on a field.
- Better handle issues with the deck list, such as decks that are missing a
parent deck.
- Anki should now be able to function even if a system proxy is configured
for localhost connections.

data folder, which you only need to change once.

To force hardware acceleration on Windows, run cmd.exe and type the following:

  echo auto > %APPDATA%\Anki2\gldriver

Available options are 'auto', 'angle', and the default 'software'.

On Linux, in a terminal:

extension.

If a search for 'http' in your collection reveals remote images, you can use

=== Changes in beta 17 ===

This release experiments with a switch from the old "mplayer" program to
"mpv", which is a newer program based on mplayer. mpv is bundled in the
Windows and Mac builds - Linux users will need to ensure it is available on
the system. The change will hopefully address issues people had with audio
being cut off or not playing properly. Please report any improvements and
any regressions.

Also:

- Added --lodpi argument in an attempt to address wrong clickboxes for some
people on Windows. If Anki suggests you use it, please right click on the Anki
icon and add --lodpi to the command line, then start Anki again. Please report
if it fixes or does not fix the problems.

- Fix filenames not being normalized when importing.

=== Changes in beta 16 ===

MathJax display environments now need to start with `\[` and end with `\\]`,
instead of using `$$`. Shortcut keys have been added to the editor to make
using these easier, but existing MathJax cards will need to be updated
unfortunately.

Backups and collection exports now use a separate .colpkg file extension,
which allows translating of their titles and allow multiple collection exports
to be stored in one folder. The other clients will be updated to understand
these extensions in the future; for now if you need to interact with them, you
can rename the file.

Also:

- Fixed backups not being made correctly on some systems.
- Fixed old backups not expiring. Anki will only look for .colpkg files now,
so you will need to manually remove your old .apkg backups.
- Collection exporting and saving graphs to PDF now lets you choose the target
folder, and the default folder is now the documents folder instead of the
desktop.
- Fix the preferences screen loading slowly, opening multiple times, and not
closing when the collection is closed.
- Fix preview window not closing on collection close.
- Fix inability to preview the answer of the last card.
- Cloze deletions should now properly remove highlighting only when in a
MathJax environment.
- Add-ons now have a persistent user_files folder - please see the add-on docs.
- Tweak margins in deck options.
- Fix searches for decks with parens in the name.
- Fix Anki interface displaying incorrectly when Windows has an incorrect mime
type for css files.
- Tweaks to the text displayed when an error occurs.
- The "oldest seen first" option in filtered decks now sorts based on last
review instead of card modification time.
- The prepareQuestion/prepareAnswer hooks have been merged into prepareQA -
please see the add-on docs.
- Don't force audio format on Windows - please let me know if you encounter
regressions playing audio.
- Clicking on a note type in the browser now searches with the name instead of
the note type ID.
- Refuse to run when locale configured incorrectly on Linux.
- Fix remaining issues with formatting being lost when cutting and copying
between fields.
- Remove the trailing `<br>` when saving a field.
- Fixed translations in dialog buttons.

=== Changes in beta 15 ===

or removed. If you have many media files and notice a slowdown when syncing,
please let me know.

- Some fixes for the add-on configuration code.
- Don't strip formatting when pasting from one field in Anki to another.
- Check Media now catches invalid filenames on Linux systems.
- Fix toggling of suspend etc when multiple cards selected.

=== Changes in beta 14 ===

Added a simple configuration mechanism for add-ons, intended for use when
users would have previously had to edit an add-on's source code. Configuration
is not lost when add-ons are updated. For more info, please see
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons21.html#configuration

Also:

- Option for showing both sides in preview screen.
- When a user starts Anki 2.1 for the first time, it will now import the profile data from Anki 2.0.

=== Changes in beta 13 ===

Add-on authors can now upload separate files to AnkiWeb for 2.0 and 2.1
support, and Anki 2.1 will automatically list and download the 2.1 versions.

The add-on menu has been moved into a separate dialog, which supports:

- checking for and downloading updates
- deleting and disabling multiple add-ons at once
- viewing an add-on's page

Add-ons are now always stored in a single folder, and need to be uploaded as a
.zip - please see the updated docs for more information:

https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons21.html#add-on-folders
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons21.html#sharing-add-ons

Fixes an issue that could allow a specially crafted .apkg file to write files
outside the media folder during import. AnkiWeb shared decks were not
affected, but upgrading is strongly recommended if you import .apkg files from
third party sources. A big thanks to David Bailey for discovering this issue.
2.0.47 is also available with this fix.

Also:

* Rewrote parts of the collection opening/closing code and window closing
code, which should ensure the collection isn't closed until windows have a
chance to clean up.

backup, which will take care of clearing out a corrupt collection and make
sure backups are not rotated when restoring.
* Added an optional sidebar to the browse screen; toggle via the Filter button.
* Icon tweaks.
* Ctrl+1-9 can be used to jump to the first 9 card templates in the card layout screen.
* Add a default note type for typing in the answer.
* Backups now include the date in the filename.
* Backups are sent to the trash instead of being deleted outright.
* Fix decks being moved to the default deck when dragged to the bottom (thanks
to David Bailey)
* Fixed some issues with field contents being updated with the wrong content.
* Better support for DPI scales that are not multiples of 100% on Windows.
* The Filter button now uses more obvious titles when splitting menus into
submenus, and will split the decks and note type lists if necessary as well.

support MathJax; the other clients will need to be updated.

-----
\(\sqrt{x^2}\)

$$x_3$$
-----

- LaTeX can now be rendered as a .svg file instead of a .png file, which can
be scaled to arbitrary sizes without losing quality. You'll need to have

The next AnkiMobile beta will support .svgs; the other clients will need to be
updated.

- make it easier for add-ons to extend bottom buttons (thanks to Dmitry)
- don't load iframe content in a separate browser window
- remove the change in beta 3 that was leading to lots of non-breaking spaces in pasted text

This beta also introduces experimental support for alternative whitespace
handling. When enabled for a note type via Tools>Manage Note Types>Options,
the editor and reviewer will wrap your HTML content in a pre-wrap whitespace
environment. What this means is that instead of using <div> and &amp;nbsp;
tags/entities to denote newlines and indents, normal newline and space
characters will be used. Things to note:

- This is experimental at the moment, and may go away if major issues are
discovered. For now, please consider it something to play around with rather
than something to rely on.

- The mobile clients do not currently support the option, though you may be
able to get cards to display the same way when reviewing on mobile by adding
white-space: pre-wrap to your card styling in your template.

- When pasting HTML into a field, Anki will try to convert the divs and
non-breaking spaces to more readable whitespace equivalents.

- Existing notes may display differently with the option enabled, because
whitespace is now respected. For example, the following on a card template:

-----
{{Front}}<br>
{{Extra}}
-----

will include two newlines between the fields, because of the newline after the
BR. To get the card to display as before, remove the <br> tag.

If your note contain manually edited HTML or HTML pasted from other websites,
they may also show differently because of the whitespace inside them.

Any feedback on what works and what does not would be appreciated.

=== Changes in alpha 5 ===

- Built with latest version of the toolkit
- Rather than completely stripping HTML or including it verbatim, paste and drag&drop now simplify the HTML as it is pasted
- Pasted images now use a checksum of the file, so pasting the same image twice will not result in multiple files
- Work around a Qt bug where some shortcut keys like 'f' were triggering menu items instead of entering characters in the type answer box
- Work around the debug console shortcut not working
- Misc other fixes (thanks to noobie, Marcio, Christoph)
- The Linux build now includes a Makefile and can be installed system-wide
- The Mac build is using a different packager. This should prevent the errors people were getting on startup, but has broken the ability to double click on .apkg files outside of Anki.
