= Known issues with Anki 2.1 =

[[hwaccel]]
== Hardware acceleration ==

The Windows and Linux builds default to software rendering, due to issues with
hardware acceleration on some computers. If you have a modern system you
can optionally enable hardware acceleration, which may result in a performance
improvement.

To force hardware acceleration on Windows, run cmd.exe and type the following:

  echo auto > "%APPDATA%\Anki2\gldriver"

Available options are 'auto', 'angle', and the default 'software'. Once
you've run the command, Anki will use the setting the next time you start it.

On Linux, in a terminal:

  echo auto > ~/.local/share/Anki2/gldriver

Available options are 'auto' or the default 'software'. Once you've run the
command, Anki will use the setting the next time you start it.

== Shortcuts on macOS ==

The toolkit Anki uses does not currently support some shortcuts like
cmd+left/right or cmd+delete when editing cards. Fn+left/right does work
instead. You can also use a third party tool like BetterTouchTool or Karabiner
to intercept the cmd+left/right keystroke when you type it into Anki, and
have it automatically be rewritten to use the function key instead.

== Fcitx on Linux ==

Currently the Fcitx input method is not supported by the packaged version of
Anki. On some systems you may be able to

but if that does not work, the only option at the moment is to switch to using IBUS instead of Fcitx.

== Text size ==

If you find the text is the wrong size, there are two environmental variables
you can try:

- ANKI_NOHIGHDPI=1 will turn off some of Qt's high dpi support
- ANKI_WEBSCALE=1 will alter the scale of Anki's web views (like the deck
list, study screen, etc), while leaving interface elements like the menu bar
alone. Replace 1 with the desired scale, such as 1.5 or 2.

On Windows you can add these to a batch file to make it easier to start Anki.
For example, create a file called startanki.bat on your desktop with the following
text:

  set ANKI_WEBSCALE=1.5
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Anki\anki"

After saving, you can double click on the file to start Anki with that setting.

== SSL errors ==

Some work and school networks intercept your internet traffic, and this can
cause errors when syncing and downloading add-ons. You can prevent the errors
from occurring by setting the environmental variable "ANKI_NOVERIFYSSL" to "1".

When you enable this option, you are telling Anki not to verify that it is
actually talking with AnkiWeb. This means that not only your work or school,
but also a bad actor on the local network may be able to intercept your
syncing traffic.
