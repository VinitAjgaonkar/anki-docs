== Errors when starting ==

If you receive the error "The application has failed to start because the
configuration is incorrect", please install
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11895

== Wifi issues on Windows ==

Previous versions of Anki on Windows could cause delays when using wifi,
due to an issue in the toolkit. If upgrading from a previous version,
please uninstall Anki before installing 2.0.51 or 2.0.52. If you updated
without uninstalling, please uninstall Anki, then install it again.

== Thai text ==

The toolkit Anki 2.0 uses becomes very slow when you use Thai text.
The alternate installer available on the download site uses a different toolkit
version which does not suffer from this problem.

== Windows XP support ==

Please use the alternate installer on the website if you are still using
Windows XP.

== Crashes ==

If you experience crashes, please try the alternate installer.
